0,""" Fair use rationale for Image:Wonju.jpg Thanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

You, sir, are still a cock-sucking douche fuck. Sit back for a second and think about what your life has become. ............ Done? That didn't take long did it? Nope. Because, as I am most certainly aware, your life is a shitstorm of sitting in front of the computer masturbating to fictional creatures. Your attempts to get rid of me are mediocre at best. You are constantly sucking the dick of failure. You don't want a personal attack, huh? Well, too bad, Fuckcock McDickerson. You've got one. From me. You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking with people because you're an overweight, single, old man in a dead-end job. Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did.
